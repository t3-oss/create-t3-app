Check out [Theo's Next.js Conf talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4UhNo3HAMw) to get a better understanding of what Next.js is and how it works.</p>

## Why should I use it?

We love React. It has made UI development accessible in ways we never imagined before. It also can lead developers down some rough paths. Next.js offers a lightly opinionated, heavily optimized approach to creating applications using React. From routing to API definitions to image rendering, we trust Next.js to lead developers towards good decisions.

Pairing Next.js with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) makes developing and deploying web apps easier than ever before. Their extremely generous free-tier and super intuitive interface provides a point and click solution to deploy your site (We ❤️ Vercel)

## Get Static/Server Props

A key feature of Next.js is its data fetching capabilities. We highly recommend reading through the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) to understand how to use each method and how they differ. `getServerSideProps` is generally discouraged unless there is a good reason for it, due to the fact that it is a blocking call and will slow down your site. [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) is a great alternative to `getServerSideProps` when the data is dynamic and can be fetched incrementally.
