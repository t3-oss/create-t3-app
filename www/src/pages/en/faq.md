## Why are there `.js` files in the project?

As per [T3-Axiom #3](/docs/t3-axioms#typesafety-isnt-optional), we take typesafety as a first class citizen. Unfortunately, not all frameworks and plugins support TypeScript which means some of the configuration files have to be `.js` files.

We try to emphasize that these files are javascript for a reason, by explicitly declaring its type (`cjs` or `mjs`) depending on what's supported by the library it is used by. Also, all the `js` files in this project are still typechecked using a `@ts-check` comment at the top.
