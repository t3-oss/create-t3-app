Drizzle is a headless Typescript ORM with [relational](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/rqb) and [SQL-like](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/select) query APIs. It can handle database migrations and schemas, and provides a type safe database client. It also comes with [Drizzle-Kit](https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview), a set of companion tools that help with querying your database.

## Drizzle Client

The Drizzle Client is located at `src/server/db/index.ts`. In this file, you can define your database connection url and connect your schema to the database object.

```ts:src/server/db/index.ts
import { env } from "~/env";
import * as schema from "./schema";
import postgres from "postgres";


const conn = postgres(env.DATABASE_URL)

export const db = drizzle(conn, { schema });
```

We recommend including the database client in your tRPC Context:

```ts:src/server/api/trpc.ts
import { db } from "~/server/db";

export const createTRPCContext = async (opts: { headers: Headers }) => {
  const session = await auth();

  return {
    db,
    session,
    ...opts,
  };
};
```

## Schema

The Drizzle schema file can be found at `src/server/db/schema.ts`. This file is where you can define your database schema and models, and connects to the Drizzle Client.

When you select NextAuth.js in combination with Drizzle, the schema file is generated and set up for you with the recommended values for the `User`, `Session`, `Account`, and `VerificationToken` models, as per the [Auth.js documentation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/adapters/drizzle).

## Drizzle Kit

Drizzle Kit is a collection of command line tools designed to help you manage your database. T3 Stack automatically includes drizzle kit when you select Drizzle as your ORM.

```json:package.json
"scripts": {
    ...
    "db:generate": "drizzle-kit generate",
    "db:migrate": "drizzle-kit migrate",
    "db:push": "drizzle-kit push",
    "db:studio": "drizzle-kit studio",
    ...
  },
```

### Script Explanations

`db:generate`
Generates TypeScript types and models from your database schema, ensuring type safety and easy integration with Drizzle ORM.

`db:migrate`
Applies pending migrations to your database, keeping your schema in sync with changes and updates in your project.

`db:push`
Pushes local schema changes directly to the database without needing explicit migration files. This can be useful for quick syncing in development.

`db:studio`
Opens a visual interface for managing and inspecting your database tables, data, and relationships.
